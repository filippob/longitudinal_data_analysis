## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```
# Load the DESeq2 package
library(DESeq2)

# Set the seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Define the number of genes, patients, time points, and genotypes
num_genes <- 500
num_patients <- 40
num_disease <- 20
num_healthy <- 20
num_timepoints <- 10
num_genotypes <- 2
num_samples <- num_patients * num_timepoints

# Generate random gene counts for patients at each time point
gene_counts <- matrix(rnbinom(num_genes * num_samples, mu = 100, size = 1), ncol = num_samples)

# Create a DataFrame with gene counts
counts_df <- as.data.frame(gene_counts)

# Assign unique gene IDs to the rows
row.names(counts_df) <- paste0("Gene", 1:num_genes)

# Create a DataFrame to store sample information
sample_info <- data.frame(
  Sample = paste0("Sample", 1:num_samples),
  Patient = rep(paste0("Patient", 1:num_patients), each = num_timepoints),
  Time = rep(1:num_timepoints, times = num_patients),
  Genotype = rep(LETTERS[1:num_genotypes], each = num_samples / num_genotypes)
)

# Assign disease and healthy labels to the patients
disease_patients <- sample(paste0("Patient", 1:num_patients), size = num_disease)
sample_info$Group <- ifelse(sample_info$Patient %in% disease_patients, "Disease", "Healthy")

# Create a design matrix
design_matrix <- model.matrix(~ Time + Group, data = sample_info)


# Create the DESeqDataSet object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = counts_df, colData = sample_info, design = design_matrix)

# Perform DESeq2 normalization
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# Run the differential expression analysis
results <- results(dds)

# Select DGEs based on adjusted p-value threshold
alpha <- 0.15  # Adjusted p-value threshold

# Subset results based on the adjusted p-value threshold
significant_results <- subset(results, padj < alpha)

# Get the gene names of the significant results
significant_genes <- rownames(significant_results)



# Convert the log2 counts to a numeric matrix
heatmap_data <- as.matrix(log2_counts[significant_genes, ])

# Diagnostic plots
plotMA(results(dds))
plotDispEsts(dds)

# Create the heatmap
heatmap(heatmap_data, scale = "row", main = "Differentially Expressed Genes Heatmap")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
